```
Please use labelme to label your image data before using the tools.

The suggested steps:

1_move_unlabeld.py
2_labelme2mask.py
3_check_image_label.py
4_split_train_data.py

grid_images.py can help yor split/cut the big picture to smaller pictures.
rotate_images.py can help you do rotation.


In general, the target folder looks like:

data\train\image
data\train\label
data\val\image
data\val\label

you can create your data\test\image and data\test\label. Of course, you can use val folder for test purpose directly.

Enjoy the tools!

Thanks,
